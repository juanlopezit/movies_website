            Adam Driver recently shared that he held on to a few sentimental props from his role as Kylo Ren in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Born the only son of Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa, Kylo Ren is the alias chosen by Ben Solo as he becomes drawn in by the alluring power of the dark side of the force. Driver made his first appearance as Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens and, throughout the trilogy, ultimately rises to become Supreme Leader of the First Order. All told, Driver portrays Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and The Rise of Skywalker.

            Kylo Ren's intimidating appearance and preferred weaponry bear some striking similarities to his Sith Lord grandfather, Darth Vader. The all-black robes, full black helmet, and red lightsaber all draw on characteristics that make up the dark side of the force. However, Kylo Ren wields a crossguard lightsaber, which is a bit different from the saber employed by Lord Vader. Nevertheless, the penchant for Sith Lords to wear such formidable and dark attire adds an extra layer of intimidation, and solidifies their identity as loyal servants of the dark side.

            In a recent chat on BBC Radio 1 (via Comicbook) Driver shares that he held on to two helmets and a lightsaber from his role as Kylo Ren in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. As Driver readily and comedically admits, this is not the first instance where he enjoyed hanging on to a few keepsakes. The talented actor also has props from various other undertakings, including Annette, The Last Duel, and The Dead Don't Die. Driver also shared that he loves to take photographs, in addition to his inclination for leaving projects with a few sentimental items in tow. See Driver's exact comments below:

            <em><strong>I have lots of stuff. I for sure have a helmet -- I have two helmets actually, a lightsaber, I have stuff from The Dead Don't Die. Every movie I try to take [something]. I take a lot of pictures, too. Sometimes I take things that are on the set, like I have a bunch of stuff from Annette, The Last Duel. I have my machete from The Dead Don't Die that I killed zombies with. I take all sorts of stuff. Then I keep them in a room and I just pray to myself as an homage to all the things that I've done.</strong></em>

            Driver's work in the Star Wars sequel trilogy earned him much acclaim from fans and critics alike. Hailed as one of the best villains to come about in the Star Wars franchise, Driver earned himself the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in The Force Awakens. He also received a second nomination for the same award regarding his work in The Rise of Skywalker. The acclaimed actor holding on to a few items to commemorate his stellar work in the franchise seems only natural. To be fair, Driver is also not the only one who swiped a few souvenirs from the set. Daisy Ridley, who portrays Rey, also admitted to keeping a few items from the set.
